Parking lots makes appearence of graphical display of numeric value and the and the parkinf lot name.

Shuttle Info displays the bus timings schedule for the naive user.

E-wallet pass,secure payment,google maps  are to be implemented as this are concerned to more advance options in the app due to limited amount of time I was unable to make much more efforts on it.

When the Admin changes the particular value of the parking lot 
for an instance 60 to 100 for boston globe 
for an instance 42 to 100 for bayside lot 

and when the general user logins in to the parking lot the values remain unchanged in order to access the lot info whether it is open or closed

NOTE : To login as ADMIN one must register as admin for the username field 
username = admin 

Incase the user forgots the password click on the forgot password button.text your email address and click on OK . Which asks the user to prompt to selected type of email and sends you the password through the email.

Currently I am still working on google maps and Payment options as this application would be a great asset to UMass boston in near future.
